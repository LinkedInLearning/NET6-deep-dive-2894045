When publishing a single file exe you *must* include the target OS type.
So that the exe is bundled for that OS.

dotnet publish -p:PublishSingleFile=true -r win-x64 -c Release --self-contained true


-- publish without .NET core runtime  (when users have the runtime)

dotnet publish -p:PublishSingleFile=true -r win-x64 -c Release --self-contained false
